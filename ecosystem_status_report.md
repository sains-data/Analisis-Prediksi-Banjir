# Hadoop Ecosystem Status Report

## Overview
The Hadoop ecosystem for the Analisis-Prediksi-Banjir (Flood Analysis and Prediction) project has been successfully configured and is now fully operational. We have fixed the previous issues with the Hive server by simplifying its configuration to use Derby as the metastore database instead of PostgreSQL.

## Components Status

| HDFS DataNode | ✅ Running | 9864 | Data replication working |
| YARN ResourceManager | ✅ Running | 8088 | Job scheduling functional |
| YARN NodeManager | ✅ Running | 8042 | Task execution working |
| YARN HistoryServer | ✅ Running | 8188 | Job history available |
| Zookeeper | ✅ Running | 2181 | Coordination service operational |
| Kafka | ✅ Running | 9092, 29092 | Message broker ready for streaming data |
| Spark Master | ✅ Running | 7077, 8080 | Computation engine ready |
| Spark Worker | ✅ Running | 8081 | Worker nodes connected |
| Hive Server | ✅ Running | 10000, 9083 | Using Derby metastore successfully |
| HBase Master | ✅ Running | 16000, 16010 | NoSQL database operational |
| HBase RegionServer | ✅ Running | 16020, 16030 | Region servers working |
| Superset | ✅ Running | 8089 | Analytics dashboard ready |
| Jupyter | ✅ Running | 8888 | Notebook server accessible |

## Hive Metastore Configuration

We have simplified the Hive metastore configuration by:

1. Switching from PostgreSQL to Derby embedded database
2. Creating a simplified `simple-hive-site.xml` configuration file
3. Setting appropriate environment variables in the docker-compose file:
   - `SERVICE_NAME: 'hiveserver2'`
   - `DB_DRIVER: derby`
   - `SKIP_SCHEMA_INIT: 'false'`

The Derby metastore has been successfully initialized and is functioning correctly. We have successfully:
- Created tables in Hive
- Inserted data into tables
- Queried data from tables

## HDFS Integration

HDFS is working correctly, and we've verified that:
- Files can be created and stored in HDFS
- Files can be read from HDFS
- The directory structure is properly maintained

## Integration Testing

We've created a Jupyter notebook `hive_spark_integration_test.ipynb` which can be used to test the integration between:
- Spark and HDFS
- Spark and Hive
- Data processing workflows

Access the Jupyter notebook at:
```
http://localhost:8888/lab?token=04000e306a9d2fb190cb95d78de8a5a19e53c320d5b08fba
```

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Verify that Hive server is fully operational
2. ✅ Check Hive logs to confirm Derby metastore is functioning correctly
3. ✅ Test integration with other components
4. Consider implementing:
   - Regular backups of the Hive metastore
   - Monitoring of the ecosystem components
   - Data ingestion pipelines for flood prediction

## Conclusion

The Hadoop ecosystem is now fully operational with a stable Hive configuration using Derby as the metastore database. All components are properly integrated and ready for data processing tasks related to flood analysis and prediction.
